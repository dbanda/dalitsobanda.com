var annotList = {"medeas":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Argument</i>.  Milton announces that he intends to follow classical precedents by beginning his epic <span lang=\"la\" class=\"mi\">in medeas res</span>, in the middle of things, and only later coming back, by reported action, to the action \"past over\" here.  The story of the rebel angels being \"driven out of Heaven...into the great Deep,\" for example, comes in <a href=\"../book_6/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">book 6</a>.</span>",
"woe":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Death into the World, and all our woe</i>. This locution echoes fairly closely Virgil\'s narrative voice in <span class=\"booktitle\">Aeneid</span> book 4, announcing that death and woe followed the ersatz nuptials of Aeneas and Dido:<blockquote>To the same cave come Dido and the Trojan chief. Primal earth and nuptial Juno give the sign; fires flashed in heaven, the witness to their bridal, and on the mountain-top screamed the Nymphs. That day was the first day of death, that the first cause of woe. (Trans. H. Rushton Fairclough in <span class=\"booktitle\">Virgil</span> vol. 1 [Cambridge, MA: Havard University Press, 1935] 407)</blockquote>See also the <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:4.160\" target=\"main\">Perseus Project</a> edition of this passage.<p></span>",

"messiah":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>one greater Man</i>.  The messiah.</span>",
"muse":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Heav\'nly Muse</i>. Is the \"Heavenly Muse\" invoked here the same as the \"Urania,\" traditionally the muse of astronomy, invoked at <a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">book 7.1</a>?  More likely, contemporary readers would have first thought of the \"Holy Spirit,\" as the inspiration of Moses.</span>",
"Oreb":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Oreb</i>.  Moses, \"That Shepherd,\" received the Law on Mt. Horeb (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Deuteronomy+4&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Deuteronomy 4</a>: 10) or its spur, Mt.

Milton wants not only to compare his project to the ancient epics, but also himself to those poets and his main character, Adam, to their celebrated heroes.  All of these comparisons raise interesting and complicated questions of authority, heroism, and nationalism in art.</span>",
"seed":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>chosen seed</i>.The people of Israel.  See <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Exodus+19&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Exodus 19-20</a>.</span>",

"Sion":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Sion</i>.  To the haunts of the classical muses near the Castalian spring on Mt. Parnassus, Milton prefers to claim Mt. Sion and its brooks Kidron and Siloa, a kind of biblically authorized Parnassus.</span>",
"chaos2":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>out of Chaos</i>.  One of Milton\'s several heterodox positions.  Orthodoxy held that God created everything <span lang=\"la\" class=\"mi\">ex nihilo</span>, out of nothing (the \"void\" of Genesis 1:2; See Calvin\'s <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Genesis/1.html\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Commentary on Genesis</span></a>).  Milton borrows the concept of chaos, or unformed matter, from <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:104\" target=\"main\">Hesiod</a> and Platonic philosophy (especially the <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg031.perseus-eng1:53b\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Timaeus</span> 53b</a>).  Milton was also a monist, holding that all things were created out of God; see <a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#monism\" target=\"main\">book 5.468-490</a>.</span>",
"aonia":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Aonian Mount</i>.  Mt. Helicon, in Aonia, sacred to the classical muses.</span>",

"brooding":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>brooding on the vast Abyss</i>.  Milton\'s \"brooding\" is a better translation of the Hebrew than the familiar \"moved upon the face of the waters\" of the Authorized version of <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 1:2</a>.</span>",
"pregnant":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>pregnant</i>.  Milton invites us to imagine the Holy Spirit copulating with the unformed matter of Chaos (\"the vast Abyss\").  In Milton\'s monism, distinctions between spirit and matter are not absolute.</span>",
"iliad":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Say first</i>. Compare this with Homer\'s invocation to the muse in the <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Iliad</span> 1.8</a>.</span>",

"Lords":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Lords of the World</i>.  According to <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 1</a>:28, human beings were created to \"have dominion\" over the rest of creation.</span>",

Interestingly, though Milton alludes to the fall of the Titans here, he likens their nine-day fall, not to the fall of the rebel angels, but to the time they spent lying vanquished on the fiery gulf after their fall. Raphael, in <a href=\"../book_6/text.shtml#line870\" target=\"main\">book 6, line 871</a>, however, tells Adam that the rebel angels fell for \"Nine dayes\".</span>",

Milton\'s preferred spelling was \"thir,\" and <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#Flannagan\" target=\"main\">Flannagan</a> reports that \"their\" was changed to \"thir\" in later stages of the 1674 edition.  The same is true of line 499 and other lines.</span>",
"ptolemy":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>from the Center to ... the Pole</i>.  Milton asks us to refer to the <a href=\"http://astro.unl.edu/naap/ssm/animations/ptolemaic.html\" target=\"main\">Ptolemaic model</a> of the universe with the earth at the center of nine concentric spheres.
